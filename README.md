# Description
This full-stack project was inspired by a Mongo, Express, Node, and React framework tutorial where I was able to dive deep into particular aspects of routing and database management.
I enjoyed this project because it was a fun and re-affirming way to practice concepts in JavaScript and Full-Stack Web Development.
